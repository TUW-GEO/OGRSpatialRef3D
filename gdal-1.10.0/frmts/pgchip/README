Important Drivers Restrictions :

    * PGCHIP driver is currently under development which means it has NOT been fully tested and no stable release is downloadable.
    
    * The driver only supports GDT_Byte and GDT_UInt16 datatypes and deals with 1 or 4 bands (GREY_SCALE, PALETTE and RGBA)
    
    * The column name for the chip is not yet changeable and is "raster" by default
    
    * In order to specify the database you want to connect to, you have to give a connection string. The differents connection parameters (host,port,dbname) must be delimited with a "#" character. The name of the Postgis layer should be given at the end of the string after a "%layer=" argument. Example : 

        $ gdalinfo PG:host=192.168.1.1#dbname=mydb%layer=myRasterTable
        
        
How can I test the driver :

    * You can choose to build your own application using the GDAL API or use the utility programs.
    * Some examples with gdal_translate :
    
        Import BMP raster :
        gdal_translate -of pgchip /DATA/myRaster.bmp PG:host=192.168.1.1#dbname=mydb#port=5432%layer=myRaster
    
        Then export to PNG :
        gdal_translate -of png -ot UInt16 PG:host=192.168.1.1#dbname=mydb#port=5432%layer=myRaster /DATA/myRaster.png
