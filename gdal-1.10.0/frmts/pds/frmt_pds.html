<h1>PDS -- Planetary Data System</h1>

PDS is a format used primarily by NASA to store and distribute 
solar, lunar and planetary imagery data.  GDAL provides read-only
access to PDS formatted imagery data.<p>

PDS files often have the extension .img, sometimes with an associated
.lbl (label) file.  When a .lbl file exists it should be used as
the dataset name rather than the .img file.<p>

In addition to support for most PDS imagery configurations, this
driver also reads georeferencing and coordinate system information
as well as selected other header metadata.<p>

Implementation of this driver was supported by the United States
Geological Survey.<p>

Due to abiguitities in the PDS specification, the georeferencing of 
some products is subtly or grossly incorrect.  There are configuration
variables which may be set for these products to correct the interpretation
of the georeferencing.  Some details are available in 
<a href="http://trac.osgeo.org/gdal/ticket/3940">ticket #3940</a>.<p>


PDS is part of a family of related formats including ISIS2 and ISIS3.<p>
