GDAL/OGR is widely used in open source and closed source applications. The OGRSpatialReference in conjunction with the PROJ.4 library is quasi standard for 2D coordinate transformation. Although, 3D transformations are - to some extend - supported within the library, the implemented solution is unsatisfactory from a geodetic point of view. The objective is to establish a rigorous 3D transformation chain, to support Vertical Datum definitions in a generic way.
