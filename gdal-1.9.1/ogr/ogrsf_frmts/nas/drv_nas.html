<h1>NAS - ALKIS</h1>

The NAS reader reads the NAS/ALKIS format used for cadastral data in Germany.
The format is a GML profile with fairly complex GML3 objects not easily read
with the general OGR GML driver. <p>

This driver depends on GDAL/OGR being built with the Xerces XML parsing 
library.<p>

This driver was implemented within the context of the PostNAS project
which has more information on it's use.<p>
