.PP
This program builds a shapefile with a record for each input raster file, an attribute containing the filename, and a polygon geometry outlining the raster. This output is suitable for use with \fCMapServer\fP as a raster tileindex.

.IP "\(bu" 2
The shapefile (index_file) will be created if it doesn't already exist, otherwise it will append to the existing file. 
.IP "\(bu" 2
The default tile index field is 'location'. 
.IP "\(bu" 2
Raster filenames will be put in the file exactly as they are specified on the commandline unless the option -write_absolute_path is used. 
.IP "\(bu" 2
If -skip_different_projection is specified, only files with same projection ref as files already inserted in the tileindex will be inserted. 
.IP "\(bu" 2
Simple rectangular polygons are generated in the same coordinate system as the rasters.
