Geo-GDAL
=======================

This is the swig-generated Perl interface to the GDAL/OGR library. The
master copy of this module is developed and distributed with GDAL. 
GDAL is available from www.gdal.org.

You need to have the development (header files etc.) versions of gdal and
geos libraries available in your system to build these modules.

The versions of GDAL and this interface must match. Makefile.PL
attempts to do that, but it is highly recommended to install Geo::GDAL
from GDAL sources.

This module is _not_ compatible with Geo::GDAL 0.11

INSTALLATION

This module can be built and installed as a part of gdal build and
installation, if you use --with-perl in configure of gdal. That
process is controlled by GNUmakefile. 

The build process comprises three steps:

1) generating the wrappers, requires swig

make generate

2) making the four makefiles

perl Makefile.PL

3) making the bindings

make -f Makefile_Geo__GDAL
make -f Makefile_Geo__GDAL__Const
make -f Makefile_Geo__OGR
make -f Makefile_Geo__OSR

this is done by simple 'make' with the help of the GNUmakefile
or Makefile in the case of dmake.

The wrappers (*_wrap.c*) are already made in distribution packages.
The wrappers in the repository are not guaranteed to be the latest
ones.

The wrappers may be tested with

make -f Makefile_Geo__GDAL test

or simply

make test

You may need to edit the Makefile.PL.

DEPENDENCIES

This module requires the GDAL library.

DOCUMENTATION

The documentation is maintained in Doxygen files. Doxygen is available
at www.doxygen.org. You will also need Perl Doxygen Filter from
http://www.bigsister.ch/doxygenfilter/ and an extension to it from
http://geoinformatics.tkk.fi/files/doxygenfilter/. To generate the
documentation type

    doxygen

You can find the documentation also at
http://geoinformatics.tkk.fi/doc/Geo-GDAL/html/. However, the
comprehensive documentation of GDAL and OGR are at
http://www.gdal.org/.
