<h1>WEBP - WEBP</h1>

<p>Starting with GDAL 1.9.0, GDAL can read and write WebP images through the WebP library.</p>

<p>WebP is a new image format that provides lossy compression for photographic images.
A WebP file consists of VP8 image data, and a container based on RIFF.</p>

<p>The driver rely on the Open Source WebP library (BSD licenced). The WebP library (at least in its
version 0.1) only offers compression and decompression of whole images, so RAM might be a limitation
when dealing with big images.</p>

<p>The WEBP driver only supports 3 bands (RGB) images</p>

<p>The WEBP driver can be used as the internal format used by the <a href="frmt_rasterlite.html">Rasterlite</a> driver.</p>

<h2>Creation options</h2>

<ul>
<li><p><b>QUALITY=n</b> By default the quality flag is set to 75, but this
option can be used to select other values.  Values must be in the
range 1-100.  Low values result in higher compression ratios, but poorer
image quality. <p></li>
</ul>
